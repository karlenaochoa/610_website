# Visualization 1: Aimed at the scientific community!

message: present parents' report of children's executive function (EF) performance and children's actually prefermonace on EF tasks by age. 

```{r viz 3}

#make data into long format
df4 <- data %>%
  gather(BRIEF_item, BRIEF_response, "BRIEF1":"BRIEF63") %>%
  mutate(BRIEF_item = as.factor(parse_number(BRIEF_item))) %>%
  mutate(BRIEF_response = as.numeric(BRIEF_response)) %>% 
  group_by(subid) %>%  
  mutate(child_EF = ((flanker_rs + dccs_rs)/2)) %>% 
  mutate(parent_EF = sum(BRIEF_response)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(parent_EF)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(child_EF)) %>% 
  mutate(parent_EF_RS = (63 - parent_EF)) %>% 
  mutate(agegroup.x = recode(agegroup.x,
                              "3" = "3-year-olds",
                              "4" = "4-year-olds")) 
```

Examine variables of interest for outliers 

Child EF
```{r}
boxplot(df4$child_EF)
```

Parent report of child EF 

```{r}
boxplot(df4$parent_EF_RS)
```

Parent report EF and child EF

```{r}
ggplot(df4, aes(child_EF, parent_EF_RS, group = agegroup.x)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

# This is the first version of the visualization.

My plan was to highlight the outliers in the plot, but there were no outliers. I added titles and axes labels and increased size of labels. I decided to add a regression line and try out a new theme. 

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(df4, aes(child_EF, parent_EF_RS)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5, color = "gray40") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title= "Children's Executive Function Score in \nRelation to Parent Report of Executive Function",
       x = "Children's Executive Function Score",
       y = "Parent-Report of Executive Function" )

plot + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=14),
           axis.text.x= element_text(size=12),
           axis.title.y = element_text(size=14),
           axis.text.y= element_text(size=12),
           plot.title = element_text(size=15),
           plot.subtitle = element_text(size=14),
           strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12))
```

## This is the final plot for the scientific community. 

I decided to facet the plot by age group rather than color by age like in my first visualization. I decided to keep the SE on the regression line because I believe it shows that there is more uncertainty for 3-year-olds. 

```{r}

finalviz3 <- ggplot(df4, aes(child_EF, parent_EF_RS)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5, color = "gray40") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~agegroup.x) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title= "Children's Executive Function Score in Relation to Parent Report of Executive Function",
       subtitle = "Relationship separated by age", 
       x = "Children's Executive Function Score",
       y = "Parent-Report of Executive Function" )

finalviz3 + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=14),
           axis.text.x= element_text(size=12),
           axis.title.y = element_text(size=14),
           axis.text.y= element_text(size=12),
           plot.title = element_text(size=15),
           plot.subtitle = element_text(size=14),
           strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12))
```
